# weather-app

This project is for my final performance task for my ICS4U Grade 12 class.

My project will be a weather web app. The app includes an input field for entering a city name and shows current weather data (temp, humidity, wind speed, etc.) with corresponding images/pictures/backgrounds to emphasize the data (Ex. If it is raining outside the background will turn rainy and the weather symbol will turn into a rain cloud). The api that's used is from https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api.
